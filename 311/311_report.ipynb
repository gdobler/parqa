    "\n",
    "1. we read DPR calls\n",
    "2. we split them into geolocated and name-located\n",
    "3. for geolocated, we spatially join them with park property, and give them property name.\n",
    "4. after that, we join two groups back and create a list of unique names - **fuzzyNames**\n",
    "5. Now, we read database of properties, and for each record convert it's Proprty ID into list with one Property ID\n",
    "6. We also create empirically defined dataframe of large parks, containing more than one property. For each park, we pass list of properties instead of one. Now we join two dataframes together in **prop2**: each record have *type* attribute, showing if this was a record from original database of homebrewed one.\n",
    "7. At this point, we use ontology we did before (ontology for Districts). We load this ontology, and manually perform some aggregation and attach **fuzz** name to each property.\n",
    "8. Then we create a custom \"fuzzname cleaning\" function to pefrorm on calls.\n",
    "9. And we try to match unique call locations with our properties. To improve matching, we perform **fuzzywuzzy process.extractOne** on unmatched ones - this helps us to improve our cleaning function. \n",
    "10. However, here we fail to recognize as much as 350 fuzz names: most of them just are not in our Proprties database, or their name changed/differs officially.\n",
    "11. **As multiple calls named after large park, not specific zone, all calls choose random element in *property_id* list: most of the calls have only one in the list, therefore, they select it all the tyme.**\n",
    "12. Both ontology pairs and matched calls are saved as csv files\n",
